# Data Storage Layer Design

## 1. Data Format Selection

- **Parquet**: Chosen as the primary format for its columnar storage, high compression, and efficient analytical query performance. Widely supported by Spark, Presto, Hive, and Delta Lake.
- **Delta Lake**: Built on top of Parquet, adds ACID transactions, schema enforcement, time travel, and versioning. Recommended for advanced data lake use cases.
- **ORC**: Considered for Hive/Hadoop-centric environments, but Parquet is preferred for broader compatibility.
- **Avro**: Suitable for streaming and row-based storage, but less optimal for analytics compared to Parquet/Delta.

## 2. Storage System Design

- **Distributed File System**: Use HDFS, S3, or cloud storage (GCS, Azure Blob) for scalable, reliable storage.
- **Directory Structure & Partitioning**:
  - Partition data by frequently queried columns (e.g., `date`, `region`, `category`).
  - Example path: `/data/processed/date=2024-06-30/region=US/`
- **Columnar Storage**: Store all processed data in Parquet (or Delta) for efficient analytics.

## 3. Efficient Querying Support

- **Partition Pruning**: Queries only scan relevant partitions, reducing I/O.
- **Indexing**:
  - Use Z-Ordering (Delta Lake) or bloom filters (Parquet) for faster lookups.
- **Caching**: Integrate with Spark/Presto caching for repeated queries.

## 4. Optimized Data Pipeline

- Ensure the pipeline writes cleaned/processed data in Parquet/Delta format.
- Integrate with Spark, Flink, or Presto for both batch and streaming support.
- Use Delta Lake for ACID, schema evolution, and time travel if advanced features are needed.

## 5. Backup & Data Recovery

- **Delta Lake**: Use time travel and versioning for easy rollback and recovery.
- **Other Formats**: Implement snapshot-based backups (e.g., S3 versioning, HDFS snapshots).

## 6. Scalability & Performance Testing

- Test query performance and storage costs for different formats.
- Simulate real workloads and perform load testing.
- Ensure the system supports horizontal scaling for large datasets.

## Example Directory Structure

```
/data/processed/
  ├── date=2024-06-30/
  │     ├── region=US/
  │     └── region=EU/
  └── date=2024-07-01/
        └── region=US/
```
